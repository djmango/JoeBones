        "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,",

        "That floats on high o'er vales and hills,",

        "A host, of golden daffodils;",
        "For oft, when on my couch I lie",
        "In vacant or in pensive mood,",
        "They flash upon that inward eye",
        "Which is the bliss of solitude;",
        "And then my heart with pleasure fills,",
        "And dances with the daffodils.",
        "Hope is the thing with feathers",
        "That perches in the soul,",
        "And sings the tune without the words,",
        "And never stops at all,",
        "We love the things we love for what they are.",
        "Perhaps the sea's definition of a shell is the pearl.",
        "Perhaps time's definition of coal is the diamond.",
        "The caged bird sings with a fearful trill",
        "Of things unknown but longed for still,",
        "And his tune is heard on the distant hill",
        "For the caged bird sings of freedom."
